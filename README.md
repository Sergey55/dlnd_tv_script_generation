# Project Overview

Project was made as part of `Deep Learning` Nanodegre program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

The main purpose of the project is to build "fake" TV script generator based on patterns recognized in [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv)

# Result

Using RNNs I have managed to create TV Script Generator which produces scripts like below:

```
    jerry: what about me?

    jerry: i don't have to wait.

    kramer:(to the sales table)

    elaine:(to jerry) hey, look at this, i'm a good doctor.

    newman:(to elaine) you think i have no idea of this...

    elaine: oh, you better take the phone, and he was a little nervous.

    kramer:(to the phone) hey, hey, jerry, i don't want to be a little bit.(to kramer and jerry) you can't.

    jerry: oh, yeah. i don't even know, i know.

    jerry:(to the phone) oh, i know.

    kramer:(laughing) you know...(to jerry) you don't know.
```
